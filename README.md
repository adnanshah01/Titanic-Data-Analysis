# Titanic Dataset Analysis

This project analyzes the famous Titanic dataset, focusing on data exploration, visualization, and potential predictive modeling. The objective is to derive insights from the dataset and possibly predict survival outcomes based on passenger attributes.

## Features

- Data loading and preprocessing using `pandas` and `numpy`.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
- Insights from the Titanic dataset, including survival trends and feature importance.

## Dataset

The project uses the **Titanic.csv** dataset. Ensure this file is located in the same directory as the notebook. The dataset contains information about Titanic passengers, such as:
- Passenger demographics (e.g., age, gender, class).
- Ticket and fare information.
- Survival outcomes.

## Setup and Requirements

The project is written in Python and uses the following libraries:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
